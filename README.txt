# Minesweeper Bot - CS 6800 Final Project
# READ ME FILE:

1) Download and install Python 3.7 or later, in case you have not done so;
    - https://www.python.org/downloads/
    
2) When saving the GIT files, make sure their arrangement is not changed so that the program can properly open the images 
   inside the /Images folder;

3) Browse to web-hosted game, available at: http://minesweeperonline.com/
    - Chrome is recommended. Using Safari has shown issues with the PyAutoGUI package;
    - Full Screen is recommended. Keep the board centralized to ensure a better performance.

4) While keeping the entire board visible on the screen, open your terminal, navigate to the program's directory (.../minesweeper)
   and execute the command: <python3 find_flag.py>
    - Yes, that is the main file.

Thanks.
